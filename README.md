The purpose of the Source code is to create Enterprise Alias for every SAP BOBJ User account. 
This will help fix the security process gap. When a SAP user gets locked or removed due to leaving company ..etc. , the BOBJ side SAP alias gets removed from BOBJ. This will lead to loss BOBJ reports tied to that account. 

The attached BO SDK Source code helps to create Enterprise Alias to all BOBJ SAP Accounts with random complex password.
